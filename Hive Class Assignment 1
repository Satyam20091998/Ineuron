1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
-hdfs dfs -put sales_order_data.csv /

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

	-create table sales_order_csv
	(ORDERNUMBER int,
	QUANTITYORDERED int,
	PRICEEACH int,
	ORDERLINENUMBER int,
	SALES int,
	STATUS string,
	QTR_ID int,
	MONTH_ID int,
	YEAR_ID int,
	PRODUCTLINE string,
	MSRP int,
	PRODUCTCODE string,
	PHONE string,
	CITY string,
	STATE string,
	POSTALCODE string,
	COUNTRY string,
	TERRITORY string,
	CONTACTLASTNAME string,
	CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
	DEALSIZE string
	)
	row format delimited
	fields terminated by ','
	TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
-load data local inpath '/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

	create table sales_order_orc
	(ORDERNUMBER int,
	QUANTITYORDERED int,
	PRICEEACH int,
	ORDERLINENUMBER int,
	SALES int,
	STATUS string,
	QTR_ID int,
	MONTH_ID int,
	YEAR_ID int,
	PRODUCTLINE string,
	MSRP int,
	PRODUCTCODE string,
	PHONE string,
	CITY string,
	STATE string,
	POSTALCODE string,
	COUNTRY string,
	TERRITORY string,
	CONTACTLASTNAME string,
	CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
	DEALSIZE string
	)
	STORED AS ORC
	TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"
 INSERT INTO TABLE sales_order_orc SELECT * FROM sales_order_csv;


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
-select year_id,sum(sales) from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select PRODUCTLINE,count(PRODUCTLINE) as BT from sales_order_orc group by PRODUCTLINE Order by BT desc limit 1;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
 select QTR_ID,sum(sales) from sales_order_orc group by QTR_ID;
 
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select QTR_ID,sum(sales)BT from sales_order_orc group by QTR_ID order by BT limit1 ;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
select COUNTRY,sum(COUNTRY)BT from sales_order_orc group by COUNTRY order by BT limit1 ;
select COUNTRY,sum(COUNTRY)BT from sales_order_orc group by COUNTRY order by BT desc limit1 ;


f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
select CITY,QTR_ID,sum(sales) from sales_order_orc group by CITY,QTR_ID;
